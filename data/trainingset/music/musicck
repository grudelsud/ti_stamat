occupying the prime real estate but other approaches are possible ones that work with but also against the museum organizational logic recently started mulling over ways playdown periods styles national borders and art history big names and sidestep the well worn paths european painting and sculpture was after something more basic kind visual cross referencing system begin optional trim the idea homing the physical stuff art suggested itself and sprang into focus during visit the met egyptian galleries before large painted pottery jar from the reign the pharoah akhenaten originally used for wine beer this amazing object decorated with abstract black blue waves red blue checkerboard and schematic blue leaves that alternate with bands plain red and dotted blue strawberrylike ovals the jar more than two feet tall but chagrin couldn recall seeing before began imagine rearranging the met vast holdings into big cross cultural categories based materials alone ceramics for example ivory jade such radical reordering would show how different materials have moved across time and through different cultures their possibilities expanding contracting according different needs and levels sophistication end optional trim pots are the perfect place start the met has the premier collection ceramics the united states and one the best and most comprehensive the world numbers just under objects and you can spend decades poring over its asian islamic pre columbian and greek ceramics and lucky for generations met curators have done just that addition there are countless pockets ceramics the museum period rooms the robert lehman collection the new byzantine galleries and course the various decorative arts galleries soon became obvious that ceramics was too much handle once and that even ceramic vessels were unwieldy category opted for pottery meaning earthenware and stoneware vessels leaving figures tiles and porcelains for another time that left plenty deal with from ancient storage jars and greek kraters through islamic lusterware and renaissance plates art nouveau vases and beyond the challenge was chart path with maximum coverage and chronological accuracy and minimum backtracking ceramics have been all cultures all the time phenomenon for several millennia the result partial timeline the form whirlwind tour that can taken different speeds you may want try the route described here brisk once over lightly pace grasp its scope and then move along the same trajectories more slowly maybe even segments looking the objects mentioned whatever catches your interest begin optional trim ultimately one benefit tour like this the restorative give and take between concentrated looking and carefree walking you may surprised how much you can see you are looking just one kind thing there also the venice effect the museum can feel crowded the piazza san marco summer day yet you duck into side street were where ceramics often dwell complete quiet sometimes prevails finally important byproduct concentrating single medium paradoxically more holistic understanding the museum multilimbed sprawl its layout history and glories well some its gaps and oversights always amazing place roam big museum like the met even better when roamed with mission end optional trim the fundamentals one really knows when was discovered that certain kinds earth were cohesive and capable being molded and then baked form portable objects suitable for cooking and for holding water the book world ceramics the editor robert charleston describes the medium the longest lived handicraft which have continuous knowledge bakable clay was discovery incalculable importance whose applications continue expand witness the ceramic shields certain space vehicles the continuity ceramics stems also from the slow but steady development different clay bodies slips and glazes the potter wheel used the egyptians early stamping and molding techniques encompasses social habits myths and religious beliefs and the economies both local industry and foreign trade well the impulse decorate and depict the world baked clay was also huge step for art its possibilities for sculpture drawing painting texture and relief may make the most aesthetically efficient art form that pots are often round seems more than symbolic the best are worlds unto themselves begin optional trim plotting tour followed eye and relied the museum extensive labels and helpful text empirical formalist approach out favor many quarters but based the assumption that what engages the mind must first excite the eye was interested seeing what could seen especially recurring decorative motifs shapes and techniques some repeat coincidence like the tight crosshatched grids found different cultures and others influence like the splashed and three color glazes called sancai tang dynasty china which are echoed islamic english and american ceramics sancai reaches apotheosis outrageousness nearly five foot tall swan footed vase one pair made wedgwood end optional trim beginning the tour best start with swing through the met egyptian galleries this isn exactly foregone conclusion there are examples relatively ancient pottery years old several other points the museum shall see but makes geographical and narrative sense the egyptian collections are just the right the museum main entrance enormous nearly self contained wing and they open with kind ceramic overture long wall densely arrayed with pre dynastic pots alive with the sense clay possibilities the display begins with the jars and bowls made red clay burned black around the rims from the badarian culture especially noteworthy are the crosshatched designs including crocodiles the amratians and the buff colored slipware the gerzean culture some decorated with spiral patterns other pieces with goddesses standing multi oared barges below these are several pots whose mottled clays were intended imitate carved stone pots which preceded ceramics nearly all the small study galleries the egyptian collection contain pots and shards worth studying keep eye out for the red and blue jar described above the corner gallery and for similar white version the adjacent gallery 17a the white piece was found tutankamen tomb gallery holds cluster smaller jars with similar decorations minus the red the greek challenge travel advisory keep mind that the met galleries greek art amount museum within museum the entire history two dimensional art seems have been rehearsed the surfaces attic pottery between and geometric form and pattern were put through their paces and what consider modern drawing was explored including caricature and cartooning fifth and fourth century vase painters all but plotted one point perspective after leaving the egyptian galleries cross the great hall and take the first right just inside the robert and renee belfer court start with little cycladic box crudely textured terra cotta then make

vitrines devoted helladic mycenaean and geometric ceramics fluidly drawn images mostly silhouettes shield bearing warriors chariots and horses are being marshaled into careful rows increasingly monumental kraters the second loop the vitrines etruscan euboean boeotian and corinthian pots nature often returns but the form stylized lions and oxen amid such depictions the relaxed almost

you find two large spaces ringed with vitrines pre columbian ceramics beginning with examples olmec pottery from which are among the plainest and most beautifully shaped the museum but the greek galleries drawing wins out reaching one zenith large cylindrical vase with white surface and incised red lines that depict imperious seated lord other high points are the ceramics andean peoples like the wari moche and chavin adjacent galleries are few african ceramics most prominently three large 20th century senufo storage jars the small display american indian objects includes ceramics although interesting how often the geometric designs mimbres and navajo potters come mind while looking early greek cypriot and iranian ceramics little backtracking things get more complicated the met second floor where several ceramic timelines and ancient cultures are represented definite must see are several bowls and large storage jar that occupy two freestanding vitrines the ancient near eastern galleries near the assyrian reliefs made iran during the fifth fourth millennium they are labeled pottery masterworks and they not disappoint hand built either red buff clay they have consummate thinness and are sparely decorated with geometric designs and schematic animals sprightly goat with big arcing horns the storage jar string tiny flamingoes sturdy footed bowl moving short flight
