young friend mine drew ramsey second year resident psychiatry the columbia presbyterian medical center washington heights has started taking voice lessons from professional opera singer before this drew musical endeavors were pretty limited had leading roles few college musicals and sang folk songs accompanying himself the guitar all sudden drew who doesn really read music has become excited opera least the idea opera since knows very little about sometimes when gets discouraged with his demanding profession has fleeting fantasies becoming opera singer all this way saying that drew was eager tag along when reviewed madama butterfly late november the metropolitan opera had never been the met had never seen madama butterfly and fully expected enjoy did not expect completely overcome was thinking since then about his reactions that remarkable performance with the soprano veronica villarroel the title role been reminded about the alluring power and importance the standard repertory all the performing arts classical music has been the most hopelessly bound past repertory essential for those who want this art form have future well history encourage new work and cajole ensembles orchestras and opera companies into supporting living composers yet such calls are not meant criticism the standard repertory these works have survived for reason the problem that repertory staples are trotted out too often for their own good easy let performances standard repertory sound standardized recapture the impact staples like tchaikovsky pathetique symphony bizet carmen performers must reconnect the daring and timeless elements these works exciting recent example this was the carnegie hall debut recital last month the french pianist pierre laurent aimard champion contemporary music especially works his colleagues and mentors pierre boulez and gyorgy ligeti this occasion aimard showed his range with brilliant probing and beautiful performances works berg beethoven liszt debussy and ligeti for once beethoven appassionata came off the radical work was when new and aimard had debussy and ligeti sounding like cutting edge 20th century soul mates hard make staple sound fresh when has achieved iconic status like madama butterfly that saturday afternoon performance was the 765th presentation the opera met history yet from the moment villarroel off stage voice wafted into the auditorium when butterfly and her attending maidens approach the hilltop house where she about married pinkerton the american naval lieutenant was clear that this year old chilean soprano portrayal puccini teen age former geisha was going special villarroel has dusky and vibrant sound she can float lovely high notes and when called for cut through the orchestra with considerable power yet her singing was not flawless her voice was somewhat hard edged the middle range and quavered full voiced sustained tones and she had some trouble with pitch still she has benefited from working this role with two trusted and quite different directors learning historical authenticity from masayoshi kuriyama and stylized abstraction from robert wilson both for productions japan villarroel portrayal the met had plenty italianate operatic passion the old style yet there was directness and honesty about her work that got the core this young woman dilemma most importantly every phrase villarroel found musical expression for her dramatic impulses she pretty much dominated everything around her though times the tenor walter fraccaro pinkerton and the conductor marco armiliato got swept her inspiration the opera conclusion when villarroel appeared alone before the curtain everyone the auditorium had the same impulse stand and cheer including and including drew who was shattered the performance tried explain when talked about later over tea said had been little down that day and had not expected have such deeply emotional reaction was little terrified feel such sadness growing the pit stomach the performance kept said the story such horribly sad descent into tragedy and just stays there and gets worse then ends this started talking about the nature tragedy most tragedy the shakespearean sense offers some degree uplift through the transformations realizations however belated the characters even play bleak neill semi autobiographical long day journey into night ends with the knowledge that edmund tyrone stand for the author pulled himself out that journey into night and became eugene neill madama butterfly offers such uplift there sense payback which drew picked butterfly agrees give their son pinkerton american wife only pinkerton himself comes for the boy just arrives she stabs herself death her way saying you did this humiliated but you are going remember forever the result what you did the uplift madama butterfly comes from puccini music the story sinks into tragedy the searing melodically haunting music expresses the inexpressible about infatuation selfless love foolish devotion motherly bonding and abject shame that puccini takes you deep provides kind comfort the comfort sad truth drew also found puccini insight into racism amazingly sophisticated pinkerton simply believes that one could think his marriage japanese child bride any way real why shouldn think that everyone butterfly family thinks the same but butterfly imbued with her own internalized racism adores him three years after pinkerton has deserted her the marriage broker goro tries persuade her accept proposal from prince yamadori she stubbornly refuses the hand effect rich handsome japanese kennedy she pathetically clings her belief that she american wife drew had interesting reaction pinkerton with whom curious way identified yes pinkerton egomaniacal ass drew put and drew sensitive and responsible newlywed devoted his wife lucy law student couldn more different but took pinkerton sense entitlement kind warning everything comes him just because this big white american uniform said drew only child grew rural indiana golden haired boy smart excellent athlete polite admired said sometimes felt had right feel insecure think drew chose his profession wisely cannot remember how many times seen this puccini favorite many those performances were forgettable but important realize that some people any performance staple like madama butterfly are hearing for the first time like drew and others are hearing for the last time was good part that audience general something uncommon was happening and everyone sensed too often however people use the classics like security blankets they wrap themselves the familiar and resist works living composers that are strange and challenging why waste time the unproven that certainly seemed the thinking some concertgoers roughly two dozen the parquet seats who left aimard carnegie hall recital early right after finished playing both books debussy images just before ended the program with three phenomenally difficult ligeti etudes perhaps few those patrons had unavoidable reasons for leaving doubt most were simply ducking out avoid the contemporary music one wise maxim criticism passed mentor virgil thomson never criticize the audience after all these are the very people you are trying win over your point view following that maxim one would sadly say that only those fleeing people had stayed they would have heard and and this time can that those audience members rushed off said myself good away stay away don need you you just keeping this whole field from moving forward aimard after playing magnificently had not earned the trust those listeners then next time let all try promoters musicians critics get more open minded people those seats people like drew that was moved madama butterfly has not left him panting see the opera again anything wants preserve that experience for while has left him eager for other new involving and challenging music that the way should work
