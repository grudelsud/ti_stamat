sometimes great musical idea comes from songwriter inspiration from felicitous pairing artist and song even from stray lick provided tuning guitarist and sometimes comes from record company executive who wants squeeze few more dollars from some old recordings that last was the case with echoes the best pink floyd drummer nick mason admits and not complaining bit while not quite matching the beatles echoes became one last year musical success stories despite the age its songs which span echoes racked impressive sales even among listeners who weren even born when the band was formed what did mason and his bandmates learn from exploring pink floyd past well shows clearly that learned absolutely nothing the last years cracks think what shows there style that was unwittingly established from the beginning and has sort stayed with mason says more seriously think that true other bands well you look something like they have very distinctive sound even though the songs are different just something you get stuck with almost don think deliberate process the drummer says fact everyone desperately trying change think and develop and move but you somehow just get set with patterns that you feel comfortable with and that feel right the end the day most bands have operate what feels right rather than trying second guess what people might like pink floyd dates back london when four students guitarist syd barrett drummer mason bassist roger waters and keyboardist richard wright formed the band taking the band name from obscure bluesmen pink anderson and floyd council they were initially influenced the blues but soon fell into the wave psychedelic rock led the beatles albums such sgt pepper lonely hearts club band think back then started sound and way assembling sound that would stay constant throughout our career mason says particularly terms overlaying sound and introducing special effects see emily play for instance has bridge that sort double time speeded tape thing that was forerunner all sorts ideas sound effects and strange noises that have been used consistently ever since still mason says even then pink floyd had fight criticism that their music with its array nontraditional noises was well weird think records was acceptable mason says but terms live music were considered completely weird and frankly fairly unacceptable think the thing find most curious that didn give one point pink floyd might well have called day when barrett who had emerged the band primary creative force singer songwriter and lead guitarist fell prey excessive use psychedelic drugs that undermined both his creativity and his reliability the group brought david gilmour friend barrett first additional member and ultimately barrett replacement originally they had hoped barrett could quit performing but still write for the band brian wilson had with the beach boys but eventually barrett went his own way ultimately becoming recluse remains this day while pink floyd continued without him was very curious way that managed carry mason says suppose was almost like the band starting again but the public eye even now however mason admits that barrett remains almost mythic cult figure with the group fans sort that james dean idea that what you see the promise that was there and you speculate what could have happened mason says and the songs still hold think their own right but think the sad thing what could have gone how much more good work could have done would have been very interesting see that thing about what could have happened adds that mystique after taking few years gain its footing the new pink floyd reached its peak the 1970s dark side the moon concept album about mental illness partially inspired barrett ordeal date has spent nearly weeks the billboard charts the longest stay any album history wish you were here and the wall which was adapted into film also went multiplatinum totaling more than million sales the band saga took turn for the worse when waters who had quit the group sued prevent gilmour mason and wright from recording and touring pink floyd the case was ultimately settled out court however and waters has continued his solo career frequently performing pink floyd material waters mason gilmour and wright all participated the compilation echoes along with james guthrie the band longtime engineer producer think everyone was agreement let say percent and then you have personal favorites and differences opinion mason says roger had his way would have had nothing from the last two albums there spirit compromise fans may hoping that the success echoes will spur pink floyd reunion but mason isn optimistic the group has been dormant since and hasn released album since the division bell each the musicians currently working his own projects including new albums waters and wright solo performances gilmour this month london and possibly some film scoring mason who also involved auto racing mason certainly hopes pink floyd will play together again haven retired yet notes but the drummer says that won even try push his colleagues into any sort action one those things that will only ever happen because people come their own free will says always there the back burner possibility but experience that people want solo stuff that has gotten out their system before they ever get around working band again but you know that all right concludes spent years waiting for the planets align quite used gary graff beverly hills mich based free lance writer editors for further information echoes
