over the years the voice inevitably fades how account for the miracle the musical theater singer barbara cook who sounds vocally fresh consider the following jan cook who had been broadway ingenue choice during the 1950s and early 60s but had struggled for some years with depression and alcoholism stepped onto the stage carnegie hall and gave her first major solo concert that triumphant comeback inaugurated cook second career concert and cabaret singer the recording that concert has become classic last february cook gave another carnegie hall concert titled mostly sondheim demanding program songs the great composer and lyricist interspersed with songs arlen berlin and others that sondheim wishes had written live recording the concert another triumph has just been released the drg label anything cook singing better than the recording not just interpretively richer which you would expect with maturity but vocally richer more expressive with just much not slightly more bloom the sound for those who might have missed the february concert lincoln center theater presenting cook mostly sondheim sunday and monday evenings through feb the vivian beaumont theater working around the performance schedule contact previews began last week the official opening jan once again cook working with her musical director the arranger and pianist wally harper who has been with her since well john burr bass recently cook discussed singing surprising turns her career and her love stephen sondheim songs interview her sunny apartment riverside drive with view the hudson river from her gold colored sofa still dimpled and blond for some time she has been stout wagnerian soprano which she gently jokes about concert this day cozy colorful tunic and black slacks she was disarmingly open can cook account for the remarkable state her voice you know jose cura just asked the same thing cook replied referring the hunky argentine tenor one many friends cook has the opera world she big opera fan who recent weeks has taken die meistersinger arabella madama butterfly and don carlo the metropolitan opera jose told been studying you and anything you sound better than ever that not supposed happen cook doesn have answer other than credit her voice teacher nearly years ago robert kobin whom she worked with for four years after moving new york from atlanta her hometown though kobin taught the principles operatic singing most his students were aspiring musical theater performers his approach made eminent sense cook don have tell you the kind claptrap that goes along with lot voice teaching she said but there are two major elements for one mysterious you look the vocal cords pavarotti and another man they look similar yet one can make this glorious sound and the other can the other hand there not lot mystery about how sound actually produced fair enough but press her demystify the production process and cook frustratingly vague other than saying that kobin taught her how put enormous energy into phrase while making sure that your body doing only what should she unable more specific what about the all important matter breath support opera singers will tell you that sound supported the diaphragm trying produce sound directly from your throat can strain your voice cook conscious supporting her voice from her diaphragm not any more honey she said slipping into remnant southern drawl you know how long been doing this the one aspect cook voice that has diminished over the years she acknowledges her range like most older singers cook has lost some top notes consequently she avoids certain songs now and must consciously prepare her voice when approaching difficult high note that might crack she said mustn load the bottom the phrase with too much sound can carry also she pointed out unlike opera singers she has the opportunity use the microphone which helps tremendously during the heyday her career musicals amplification had not yet invaded broadway theaters like great pop vocalists from bing crosby barbra streisand cook has long relied microphone make her intimate singing carry throughout large auditorium wouldn think trying heard without she said rip myself pieces sing rather softly these days when was really hitting broadway found singing pianissimos difficult now find them easy ultimately she says her voice gift from early she can remember cook could bring pleasure people with her singing though her father traveling salesman who sold ladies hats and her mother telephone operator who became housewife enjoyed the pop songs the day they were not musically gifted but they loved hear her sing after her barber cut her hair would ask young barbara sing and she would comply with something like wishing will make from snow white she was always asked sing people weddings which being shy girl she would only she could out sight she never learned read music mean know from down she said but not much else still she highly respected musician just ask the juilliard school students who flock her master classes the art singing musical theater song when she was about cook acquired patron woman town who insisted remaining anonymous she found person teach voice cook said patron paid for lessons and trolley fare never found out who she was the age she traveled with her mother for the first time new york even before arriving she knew she would never home atlanta she had only seen movie musicals new york she finally attended real show oklahoma she was terrified looked stage and realized that what want but how will ever what those gods and goddesses there are doing she took job statistical typist and studied voice with teacher who didn help and didn hurt she sang supper clubs including nine month stint boston and auditioned for shows finally getting role the now forgotten flahooley two years later her amazement she wound singing ado annie the national tour oklahoma but her breakthrough role was cunegonde leonard bernstein candide which opened bernstein had recruited trained opera singers like robert rounseville for his vocally demanding score far the toughest song was cunegonde glitter and gay sort mock homage the jewel song from gounod faust except that the coloratura roulades trills and stratospheric high notes that bernstein called for were far more difficult when she auditioned cook had never sung note higher than just above the treble staff least public she could toss off coloratura high notes galore herself but her was like trick like pretending opera singer intrigued her audition bernstein wanted hear cook high range she offered sing madama butterfly entrance music with its arching lines and climactic high flat but she did not have the score with her not worry said bernstein who knew heart impressed asked her she could trill told him but can fake said and this funny that fine practically everyone else fakes anyway bernstein asked her work glitter and gay for few days with the show music director samuel krachmalnick the next time bernstein popped hear how things were going cook boldly suggested that alter vocal lines couple places better accommodate the text did imagine that cook said recalling her gumption but may have impressed bernstein who had plenty ego but was perpetual student heart lillian hellman who wrote the original book the musical was hesitant about casting doll faced southerner the role she wondered could play young aristocratic european girl cook recalled said think but hell had only been niagara falls and tijuana still don know why got the part guess presented the package they wanted sweet ingenue look could act could sing led other landmark roles including marian the librarian the music man the next year for which she won tony award and amalia balash the jerry bock and sheldon harnick musical she loves classic broadway score that was swept aside the hello dolly phenomenon that came early the next year the mid 60s cook troubles with depression alcohol and overeating had grown critical her year marriage david legrant comedian ended divorce their son was then adam legrant now living happily los angeles his mother said proudly but the late 60s were hard years for cook drank every day she said not the days worked usually which were not many but otherwise come clock start drinking and keep drinking until fell into bed she was still drinking she said the time the carnegie hall concert was not until two years later that finally stopped after trying and trying just stopped for some kind spiritual thing they are literally knocked the floor some kind blinding something was like that for her she said kind gift begin optional trim the bad years may have deepened her sensitivity though after all the talk about vocal technique finally cook ability connect with lyric allow herself vulnerable that makes her such compelling artist listen the way she bends the phrases losing mind from sondheim follies the new recording her carnegie hall concert the vocal lines seem the distracted thoughts bereft woman for whom every mundane thing life painful reminder the sun comes think about you the coffee cup think about you the way cook sings almost she speaking yet there wistful warmth her sound want you she sings coaxing her voice the top note the phrase where turns patchy achy and unforgettable like losing mind talking about sondheim songs cook said there are times she wishes she did know how read music tricky kidding take happiness for example the song from passion that actually duet between the young soldier giorgio and his winsome lover clara her program cook will repeat the version the song that conflates the alternating vocal parts into single bobbing melodic line that plays against the steady meter with shifting verbal and vocal twists end optional trim surely cook must have daily practice regimen for keeping her voice shape don anything she said grew with this idea that the voice sort there actually few years ago she was beginning concert with quiet thing kander and ebb song that called for very soft very delicate singing she said found and embarrassed say this that warmed first was easier recent years she has been warming before concerts not lot some octave jumps and things seems scant concession age considering the benefits her ardent fans derive
