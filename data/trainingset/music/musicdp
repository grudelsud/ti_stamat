does genius exist the idea generally seems highly exaggerated great reputations grow regardless talent acclaim assisted luck wealth superior perches are reached through sycophantism exploitation and tastes change over time one era genius can become another era fraud but the midst the politics accident power and manipulation there anything else any artists deserve transcendent label one time such questions would have seemed somewhat strange philosophers have argued about how define genius not about whether exists but challenges the idea validity have become commonplace recent years genius has been judged little more than product good marketing good politicking has been seen form intellectual imperialism presumptuously asserting its power beethoven and the construction genius tia denora patriarchal imposition feminine achievements gender and genius christine battersby and relatively unimportant phenomenon compared with cultural politics various historical and musicological papers the philosopher peter kivy the recently published book the possessor and the possessed handel mozart beethoven and the idea musical genius notes that now fashionable suggest that genius reduces something else something indeed that not very terrific tries reduce the reduction the urge reduce the idea genius may even arise because the immensity its claims according commonplace descriptions genius creates artworks beyond the abilities the merely talented genius achievements are uninfluenced vagaries taste and marketplace fact genius may shunned first and only later acclaimed addition the ways which such geniuses shakespeare beethoven are hailed vastly different eras and cultures suggest that there cross cultural and objective element genius the existence artistic genius would support
