wouldn have thought any would happen altman says arrogantly probably would have thought would happen there not too much know now that wish knew all those years ago adds think everything part process don think you can rush things don think you can ahead yourself when working say that inside the bubble there with the actors and the artists who are making film with don think about much else but that bubble hasn changed much over the years says the oscar nominated director brewster mccloud california split nashville wedding the player short cuts and and the women the industry has changed and not for the better but just keep making films and thank god people are still interested them his latest gosford park already generating oscar buzz limited release offbeat even for altman blend murder the orient express and upstairs downstairs that unfolds english country estate typically remarkable altman cast including eileen atkins alan bates charles dance stephen fry michael gambon derek jacobi helen mirren jeremy northam clive owen ryan philippe maggie smith kristin scott thomas emily watson and james wilby peoples story murder and intrigue among the upper classes and their backstairs servants not sendup much altman says telephone from his los angeles beach house but taking off the whodunit the british class struggle type story and few other things figured out after many conversations about gosford park that the upstairs part comedy and the downstairs part drama different from much work says but similar film wedding many ways that had about the same number characters there were also two class structures there and was all set under one roof altman camera swoops around the stately estate pausing stairwells and assorted nooks and crannies catching the characters private moments joy bitterness despair and jealousy the process the incredibly humble list actors times become background extras the camera puts the audience the position being eavesdropper altman says peeping tom situation almost the way see both for the audience and the characters too since they all always watching each other try put the audience position where they kind have reach and stretch and look for things the director says like they looking through window all these characters pretty much that way all films maybe more this one than some others because the nature the story try not serve everything audience adds television does that everything told you six times try put people notice that they better pay attention they shouldn see gosford park they won get they don pay attention commercially that dangerous say the least commercially speaking altman himself dangerous for all their starry casts and often heady reviews his films rarely make much money the other hand they produced for modest sums and get those big name talents for reduced salaries they don lose much either want the people who put money make their money back altman says and one films makes money makes the next one much easier for accomplish one doesn make money makes things harder get something else made one way the other but obviously rather easy than hard that the main reason why get involved all these award situations and doing interviews which not favorite thing the director admits gosford park finished and can really anything about the film itself about the quality the content thrilled with and don think ever done better film but done child that has been formed and born and out there its own wish well and doing everything can help but basically out there recently altman sat
