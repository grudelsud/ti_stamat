when spoke the news media after that dec game the saints violated league rules martz said generating artificial noise the superdome mostly with music when the rams were calling their offensive plays the noise supposed cease when the offense breaks the huddle the rams complained the league office but fines were assessed against the saints seemed that martz chose strange time make issue about such trivial matter most coaches would have let win easily and then complain about noise considered rubbing but that martz and the scene was example what makes him different and some would add hard figure out head coach pro football since buddy ryan who was once called fat jerk jimmy johnson irks his peers like martz may look like kindergarten teacher but martz the man people love hate classless what jets center kevin mawae said martz team after the rams called for onside kick this season despite having point lead late the second half after early season game new orleans coach jim haslett used obscenity describe series trick plays that martz threw the saints don think knows what talking about what giants cornerback jason sehorn said after martz insulted him this year then there are the comments some coaches and assistants when asked last week for their opinions martz cocky and talks too much and full himself were some their responses all these things about martz mad mike called some may true but something else also true right now there not more innovative bright and bold offensive coach the league martz league full too many politically correct coaches breath frank fresh air and get used him because martz and his rams will around for some time they are favorites win the super bowl this year and will contenders for years come mike true good guy and smart leader louis quarterback kurt warner said from the outside think people have impression him that don see just see him great coach martz was asked after the rams beat the saints their second meeting was concerned about his growing bad boy reputation said just always try myself and don worry about what people say about martz the 21st century version bill walsh joe gibbs and like them martz has his team playing

simple gets the football the hands his playmakers like running back marshall faulk any means necessary and his play calling goes beyond simple deep passes and running plays there are myriad reverses pitches options and gadget plays martz playbook like his team martz aggressive and unapologetic consider these martzisms when asked why physical defenses like those the saints and the giants give his
