the success birdbrain suggests that today dancegoers are not airheads birdbrain garry stewart quirky production for his australian dance theater adelaide was one the hits the autumn season the joyce theater advance publicity described updated swan lake sense was but what the audiences who flocked the joyce found may not have been what they expected unlike matthew bourne whose own unconventional swan lake transformed that 19th century russian classic into satire contemporary england birdbrain had almost plot although few snippets tchaikovsky score were heard most the work was danced electronic sounds jad mcadam and luke smiles and the dancers wore shirts and slacks rather than tutus and tights all this may have initially startled dancegoers but ultimately delighted them for stewart choreography was stylistic mixture that inventively blended classical ballet and modern dance with hip hop acrobatics and yoga birdbrain was fun watch was also fun think about and the fact that stewart presumably considered his audience willing and able think about sign the sophistication the dancegoing public ballet has taken sufficient root our culture that swan lake has over the years become well known artistic entity giselle coppelia and several other works from the classical repertory are almost equally familiar indeed can argued that the characters those ballets have attained the status mythical archetypal figures choreographers can treat they choose just playwrights have long been free take personages from classic greek tragedies and manipulate them they see fit thus characters corresponding orestes and electra appear eugene neill mourning becomes electra but the setting 19th century america not ancient greece more than scenery and costume designs are involved the most radical adaptations dance myths one can set swan lake any locale period and still dance the traditional steps but today some choreographers enjoy reinterpreting standard works make their own personal points and the assumption that audiences will recognize both the source and the reasons for the innovations just mourning becomes electra refers back greek tragedy yet totally original drama birdbrain simultaneously alludes swan lake and remains choreographically independent addition birdbrain and bourne swan lake new yorkers have been jolted stimulated over the last two decades several such free fantasias old balletic themes the brooklyn academy music the cullberg ballet stockholm presented bleak new version giselle the swedish choreographer mats the exploitation women was one major themes and emphasize made albrecht giselle perfidious lover elegant man contemporary formal attire while giselle looked gullible seem almost simple minded and she was eventually shipped off insane asylum two light hearted reworkings old ballet scenarios were created the french choreographer maguy marin for the lyon national opera ballet the company brought her cendrillon cinderella the city center this production retold the old fairy tale the sweet score prokofiev wrote for russian choreographic version the story but conceptually and visually this was surprising staging all the action took place enormous dollhouse and all the dancers portrayed dolls representing such figures cinderella her bossy stepmother and stepsisters and the gallant prince first seemed perverse turn vivid human characters into dolls but marin had more than the cinderella story mind the dolls moved from incident incident the choreography conveyed sense that they were the embodiment child imagination just children when they play can invest toys with their own hopes and fears marin suggested that these dolls expressed the feelings the child who remained invisible whom the dollhouse belonged therefore was significant that addition the prokofiev music the taped accompaniment included sounds crying babies the ballet characters may have been artificial but the crying implied that emotional responses their predicaments could real and intense almost decade later the new york state theater marin offered modern dress treatment another familiar ballet involving dolls coppelia the original version franz fails realize that coppelia the beautiful woman has glimpsed balcony really doll while coppelius the doll crazed inventor tries bring life critique the way popular culture can mesmerize and befuddle marin made coppelia seductive film image begin optional trim for all their modifications source materials and marin still preserved narrative bearing some relation that the ballets they adapted but birdbrain stewart came close discarding all narrative they wished balletgoers could simply have enjoyed his free spirited choreography nevertheless references swan lake did float into view which knowledgeable ballet fans surely spotted dancers wore shirts with the names the ballet characters them although there were sustained impersonations these people some projected video sequences included sentences briefly summarizing the plot swan lake yet story was literally enacted the hunting scene swan lake was recalled when archer shot arrows into enormous feathered heart some dancers with linked hands resembled the original ballet cygnets but instead doing crisp steps the cygnets traditionally they slithered and when dancers white shirts filled one side the stage while dancers black shirts occupied the other ballet lovers might have recalled that odette the virtuous swan queen swan lake traditionally wears white while odile the evil sorcerer daughter wears black stewart also included melancholy fluttering gestures associated both with odette plight and with the dying swan solo made popular anna pavlova that has nothing with swan lake although unwary newcomers ballet sometimes assume does end optional trim one remarkable thing about birdbrain was that despite his choreographic mischief stewart did not really treat the original swan lake with contempt instead showed fundamental respect for that work and for classical ballet general one his video sequences included well chosen list great ballerinas who have starred swan lake over the years other video sequences showed hearts flowers and stars all them icons balletic romanticism lovers dance history were surely delighted find among the projected video images some the drawings the endearingly earnest young dance students that adorn the technique manuals carlo blasis one the 19th century most influential ballet masters during the conclusion birdbrain stewart dancers carried their limp partners across fogbound stage while video documentary depicted the curtain call performance swan lake these juxtapositions were strangely poignant and one sensed that for all his prankishness stewart acknowledged the power the traditional swan lake that swan lake spectacle filled with mystery and magic its own way birdbrain attention editors all photos and graphics from the
