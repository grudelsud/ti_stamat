teams defeats the cornhuskers not all coach larry coker said wednesday when asked the hurricanes must win decisively guarantee the school fifth national crown the team the country win one point the undisputed national champions different story nebraska one touchdown underdog defeats miami there are plenty people oregon country and beyond who say nebraska doesn deserve the title game after its

espn coaches polls the cornhuskers were each that made the ducks quacking mad too bad says nebraska coach frank solich people are tired saying but played games better than anyone the country said solich bowl games weren challenged until the very end feel very strongly the bcs formula worked out the way supposed work out nebraska wins could result split national champions voters the coaches poll are bound agreement award their title the winner the rose bowl but voters the media poll can select whichever team they want and may choose oregon over nebraska leading the fourth split national title since but nebraska faces miami team that has won straight games since losing washington the second game the season even the coaching change from butch davis coker had little effect fortunes the hurricanes win coker will become the first coach years lead his team undefeated season and national championship his first year wife was told that need win this game and then retire coker said but need day job miami finished first nationally scoring defense and third scoring offense the hurricanes special teams are virtually unmatched even quarterback nebraska senior and heisman trophy winner eric crouch has clear advantage over miami ken dorsey but there are areas concern for coker has lost three key players since the end the regular season fullback najeh davenport and linebacker chris campbell both starters won play tonight because injuries receiver ethenic sands miami third leading pass catcher out after being suspended that factor the game coker said certainly coker also worried about nebraska option attack which led the nation rushing for the second straight season and 13th time the last years haven played option team this year and that concern coker said solich has his own problems like which nebraska team will show tonight the one that breezed through its first games the one that was manhandled boulder colorado not questioning ourselves solich said will team that filled with confidence that will step the field know what against but you don suit red and white without feeling you going win the colorado game will have effect that some say that nebraska which hasn
