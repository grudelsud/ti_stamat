you are wondering how get rid that fruitcake you received for christmas advised that blasting the thing with submachine gun will little damage would like brag that performed this test personally but unfortunately neither wife nor the newspaper company work for allows play with automatic weapons even situations involving fruitcake but more tolerant attitudes apparently prevail nevada where reporters with the reno gazette journal performed series experiments determine what takes bring down fruitcake the first experiment involved dropping fruitcake from the roof two story building onto concrete basketball court you might expect this did absolutely damage the fruitcake word how much cost repair the basketball court nor was there any mention how many people given choice would rather eat section basketball court than piece store bought fruitcake perhaps these questions will addressed second study next christmas the second test involved running over fruitcake with pound sport utility vehicle this proved more effective leaving tire marked raisin flecked smear the asphalt according gazette journal reporter camille hayes this certainly comes good news people like who thought suvs were good for nothing except rolling over and sucking gasoline the rate gallon second even when they are not turned hope the makers suvs are made aware this ground rather fruitcake breaking study and incorporate into future commercials you believe the commercials out now most people buy suvs for the purpose having them set down helicopter atop high narrow peaks the middle the desert this could fun suppose but think many more americans would inclined buy suv they knew that alone among all the forces nature was capable rendering fruitcake into and quote tire marked raisin flecked smear the asphalt third test had football place kicker attempt yard field goal with fully loaded fruitcake this sounded like dangerous stunt and had visions the place kicker foot shattering crumpling into accordion shape much like the coyote nose does when runs into rock wall while chasing the road runner thankfully neither these things happened the fruitcake actually disintegrated explosion candied fruit something that probably wouldn have happened the fruitcake had been sitting around for year two most fruitcakes finally hayes set two fruitcakes and blazed away them with pair fully automatic submachine guns this resulted only minor damage she reported the larger cake proved especially resilient she said rather than shattering into the smithereens had expected the volley bullets merely nibbled its edges for the dark center the beast proved too dense lose its shape applaud this study for taking journalism into new uncharted territory and then returning more less intact save for few bullet holes but the best news that hayes and her intrepid team fruitcake abusers will perform second round tests next year including but certainly not limited dropping fruitcake from helicopter clearly they will needing lot fruitcakes for their ongoing experiments which why suggesting that you collect all the unused fruitcakes lying around your house including the one you use prop the door
