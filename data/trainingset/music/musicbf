couldn more basic after few words introduction act delivers its hit for television cameras and enthusiastic arm waving audience all the hits are rising the top hanging and typical top the pops packs eight them with the other top hits named briefly near the end the difference between top the pops and most televised countdown shows that uses the promotional video clips seen mtv and everywhere else only last resort nearly all the groups that appear each top the pops perform the show studio live partly live lip synched often with production numbers diet wall wall clips isn video music programming said chris cowey who has been the executive producer and director top the pops since rather people interpretation the record enriches the experience for the audience and unique the show produced

there month waiting list for tickets band tour carries through london before has reached the charts the show grabs for segment shown few weeks later and song lingers the charts top the pops tries broadcast multiple versions acoustic remakes funk remixes least costume change cowey rarely does second takes although will take mercy singer with disastrously bum note said despite the amount lip synching the show said want feel live want feel real top the pops has become what cowey called more benign british empire now seen territories outside great britain with the potential reach tens millions viewers top the pops doesn get turned down many acts madonna paul mccartney can come little studio perform why can everybody else cowey said the bbc also broadcasts top the pops with clips
