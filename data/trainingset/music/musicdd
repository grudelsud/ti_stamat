mercury study myth persists despite facts attention editors this article from the newhouse news service report friday january available separate buy for information about purchasing the article contact debra weydert the new york times syndicate fax mail weyded nytimes com optional trim words bill finch and ben raines newhouse news service undated most researchers agree that mercury levels the environment and the fish eat have increased dramatically result human activities environmental protection agency researchers say there abundant evidence that mercury levels the environment have increased the range percent percent over the last century but recent meeting the gulf states marine fisheries commission phil spiller the head the food and drug administration seafood division said just the opposite mercury levels fish insisted have not changed significantly since the 19th century was dramatic statement coming did meeting gulf coast regulators and scientists who were attempting decide what about high mercury levels recently discovered gulf coast fish and people the implication was clear people are more danger mercury exposure now than they were century ago spiller who oversees the safety the nation seafood supply cited study said involved mercury testing year old fish samples from the smithsonian institution washington the mercury levels those fish said were lower than mercury found samples modern fish but research the mobile ala register has revealed that the study spiller referred was considered flawed that some the original researchers refused publish and spiller conclusions about mercury levels fish appear dangerously off base spiller isn the only person cite the called smithsonian study recent months meetings between register reporters and seafood officials and researchers the smithsonian study was mentioned repeatedly unfortunately one who cited the research including spiller had ever actually seen the study knew where could found like urban myth said steve heath mobile area marine biologist who had heard the story spiller gave the tale new measure respectability when referred the oct meeting the fisheries commission new orleans spiller was asked provide documentation the smithsonian study the commission commission members said last month that had yet send copy the study spiller would not comment telling the reporters would not speak them about any mercury related issues but register reporters did find the infamous smithsonian study well one the original researchers according susan jewett collections manager for the division fishes the smithsonian national museum natural history there have been two important studies mercury using the smithsonian fish collections recent decades the first was published volume science magazine that study compared 19th century tuna specimens housed the smithsonian with fresh and canned tuna collected and jewett said the levels mercury had not changed significantly the researchers wrote which lend support the contention that mercury levels now being found wide ranging ocean fish are not primarily the consequence man made pollution but are natural origin apparently however the publishers that study failed take into account that preservation techniques widespread use the smithsonian and other museums tended alter the heavy metal content museum specimens some cases mercuric chloride compound virtually identical the mercury pollutants emitted many industries may have been used preservative fact the original researchers that project abandoned attempts publish the report when they realized that there were likely contamination problems with the museum specimens according one the researchers who requested that his name not used that researcher said was unaware that the team work had ever been published the conclusions that science article were called into question the same magazine according jewett researchers from the smithsonian published another article presenting evidence that the method preservation well metal tags and other artifacts preservation can alter the levels heavy metals such mercury the preserved fish response questions from the reporters jewett wrote you can see difficult make assumptions about mercury other chemical levels fish based museum specimens since you never will know the results from the museum specimen represent natural situation result contamination degradation over time while stored the museum optional trim follows recent years other studies have been far more careful account for tainted museum specimens studies european researchers published the journal applied ecology and examined the feathers north sea shore birds and atlantic ocean sea birds testing only for methylmercury the dangerous organic form mercury that binds readily living tissue the researchers were able avoid the contamination problems caused inorganic mercury found preservatives their research showed that mercury levels most the late 20th century birds they studied had increased two four times over levels seen birds collected before they also were able show that mercury levels the birds fluctuated with peaks mercury production and pollution europe during world war and the period increasing industrialization europe from through another study sea birds conducted remote areas the baltic sea the faroe islands and greenland showed that mercury levels increased from range parts per million before parts per million between and some the most recently sampled birds mercury levels were well excess the levels known inhibit reproduction itself good indication that the heavy metal concentration was considerably higher than what the birds had been exposed over millenniums bird populations that can reproduce the
