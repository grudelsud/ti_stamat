notably michael kater book composers the nazi era which has just been published paperback part the festival kater will take part symposium who was richard strauss jan the classical music critics the new york times are providing backdrop sorts listing their favorites among the many strauss recordings now available but warned the chaotic classical record market the present trying determine

especially soprano voices say what you will about his operas they indisputably offer singers all types and categories some the most seductively rich roles the repertory not surprising that the strauss operas have fared well vocally recordings still takes great strauss conductor bring cohesion his voluptuous brilliant but times long winded scores take der rosenkavalier several classic recordings offer glorious singers these touchstone roles but leonard bernstein conducting that makes his recording with the vienna philharmonic favorite while there plenty suppleness his viennese waltz rhythms bernstein not beholden the heritage this opera but delivers fresh and lucid performance turns excitingly fleet and poignantly spacious and the cast wonderful with christa ludwig rich voiced worldly marschallin gwyneth jones slightly rough edged but ardent octavian walter berry robust and obsequious baron ochs and lucia popp heavenly voice the most sublime sophie ever obviously birgit nilsson acclaimed portrayal the title role compelling reason own decca recording salome her singing alluring mix cool nordic sound and blazing vocal charisma the rest the cast also strong eberhard wachter jokanaan gerhard stolze herod grace hoffman herodias georg solti dynamic shimmering conducting the vienna philharmonic has never been topped working again with the vienna philharmonic solti gives matchless performance arabella decca recording draws affecting performances from peerless cast lisa della casa the title role hilde gueden zdenka george london mandryka and otto edelmann waldner the recording goes and out circulation but you should find the larger stores the new deutsche grammophon recording ariadne auf naxos offers splendid cast headed the great deborah voigt the title role with ben heppner natalie dessay and anne sofie von otter but giuseppe sinopoli conducting times fussy and hard driven favorite ariadne remains herbert von karajan magisterial performance with the philharmonia orchestra and distinguished cast including elizabeth schwarzkopf ariadne rudolf schock bacchus and irmgard seefried the composer when comes being fussy some strauss buffs find schwarzkopf singing exactly that beautiful sure but mannered yet even detractors have concede that her performance the countess emi recording capriccio model vocal elegance and directness nicolai gedda and dietrich fisher dieskau are excellent the smitten composer and the poet vying for her affections this chatty but beguiling opera which turns story romantic rivalry into dialectic about the relative importance words and music opera finally though wolfgang sawallisch pliant conducting the philharmonia orchestra that makes this the recording choice anne midgette operas die aegyptische helena leonie

hotter cologne radio symphony orchestra and chorus conducted richard kraus koch schwann two cds like strauss for all the wrong reasons seduced the outpourings lush melody the honey that thickly trickles through his scores can defend him against charges superficiality his magnificent orchestrations add weight his music mask its banality deny that wrote some ineffably silly operas the plot arabella flimsy television sitcom masquerading serious drama behind its wonderful music die aegyptische helena seems utterly indefensible how can you take seriously opera that features omniscient seashell one its best cameo characters the answer that you can take helena seriously when you have leonie rysanek pouring out the title character rivers music and arabella does become heart tugging and dignified when led wolfgang sawallisch perhaps the greatest living strauss conductor although hasn had much chance show his abilities american opera houses number his live performances from munich are preserved house opera rom the operas richard strauss essential reference tool since offers all the composer operas some multiple performances the point that for strauss more than many other composers rises and falls with the performance not helena but rysanek helena that grips less salome than hildegard behrens intense utterly committed reading the title role and big key these performances style not easy quality learn favorite strauss performances are all from the german speaking world erich kleiber rosenkavalier perfect example this performance steeped vienna its eyeballs you can mimic the arch flirtatiousness masking deeper feeling that comes out hilde gueden spirited distinctive sophie maria reining aging but sparkling marschallin even kleiber nuanced brilliant characterful conducting anyone did this way today would seem like parody there essential lightness even ludwig weber magnificent ochs that keeps the performance from ever becoming heavy handed one favorite recordings all time any opera the live frau ohne schatten from vienna which could set you weeping for the days when there was james king around sing the emperor gorgeous brainless music with the beauty demands not mention rysanek match him passionate empress this opera too you get that arch tongue cheek quality this account keeps the fairy tale from attaining quite the profundity wagnerian archetype despite its wagnerian scale and here the magnificent wagnerian singers picking elektra hard call when the choice between inge borkh lisa della casa and jean madeira under dimitri mitropoulos live orfeo recording and astrid varnay rysanek and hans hotter koch schwann you could almost flip coin with some regret for mitropoulos magnificent conducting choice falls the koch partly because the recording quality this radio broadcast results vividness sound and text that make this like radio play and partly because rysanek her first outing the role chrysothemis before she made her stage debut and varnay are quite simply perfection bernard holland instrumental works piano works ophelia lieder enoch arden glenn gould pianist elisabeth schwarzkopf soprano claude rains speaker sony

operas was essentially symphonic composer given making the orchestra crucial engine the drama not just means support for singers applied his symphonic works this wagnerian approach yielded music with distinctly drawn characters from the picaresque prankster till eulenspiegel the hero painted ein heldenleben and colorful sometimes grandiose plot lines the works that don fit that description exactly many are painterly alpine symphony and some aim evoke the metaphysical tod und verklaerung naked emotion the devastation the postwar metamorphosen beyond their storytelling and scene painting appeal strauss tone poems are also textbooks orchestrational brilliance strauss time this made them ideal showpieces for conductors and orchestras and that turn paid unexpected dividends the recording era yet for all the advances sound recent decades have brought fritz reiner recordings also sprach zarathustra and ein heldenleben remain favorite accounts those pieces both terms interpretive depth and

the centerpiece esa pekka salonen disc moving but never lugubrious account metamorphosen included well pleasant rarity the duett concertino essentially double concerto for clarinet and bassoon salonen own string orchestra arrangement the prelude capriccio while arguably superfluous approaches that graceful work from fresh perspective another rarity strauss ballet score josephslegende slightly better known its reduced form symphonic fragment the sinopoli recording presents the music its full evocative glory strauss early chamber works have had comparatively few advocates and there are few recordings currently print the work that turns the concert hall most often the violin sonata thoroughly brahmsian sound and gesture vadim repin and boris berezovsky give performance that takes the late romantic emotionalism its time into account but the more interesting aspect their reading the extent which they have grafted the high drama strauss later music onto the contours this early score
