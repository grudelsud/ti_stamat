the more you learn the more there learn there one big message coming from the intellectually ambitious field african art history these days that learning about the art africa has just begun the american collector lawrence gussman started learning his first trip africa during his stay visited the hospital run albert schweitzer the central african nation gabon deeply moved the medical work being done there returned volunteer every summer for the next years after immersing himself western museum collections began buying african art from dealers and auction houses the united states and europe the hundreds objects acquired from textbook classics hard identify rarities spanned much continent but focused the central african countries knew best from personal experience gabon angola and congo formerly zaire divided his collection gift among three institutions the neuberger museum purchase college the state university new york the national museum african art smithsonian institution washington and the israel museum jerusalem this year choice pieces from all three have been assembled for personal journey central african art from the lawrence gussman collection exhibition organized christa clarke the curator african art the neuberger where now appears the objects selected adhere gussman core regional interest and are sorted into thematic categories type and use reliquary guardian figures masks objects associated with status and spiritual power but even with this easy grasp ordering the impression one irrepressible boundary crossing diversity and invention visual motifs borrowed exchanged adapted transformed this dynamic isn all surprising given that the show encompasses nearly three dozen distinctive central african cultures many which are related and none which have been static each has produced artists varied intentions and skills answering different demands each culture however insular outside forces colonial politics trade invasion environmental change have had their effect wonder the show rich apparent incongruities objects within single area will show marked differences style and form while pieces geographically far flung have similarities for the historian this means that old ethnological demarcations vanish shift and new cultures appear but what really happening life just doing its complicated organic thing the interaction art and life what makes the study african art exciting and collection like gussman shaped one person direct experience with particular cultures contributes the excitement all this comes through the show which the familiar and unfamiliar are balance this immediately evident the section devoted reliquary guardian figures created surmount the earthly remains village ancestors fang figures from gabon with long torsos muscular legs and dark stained skin are old favorites western collectors and gussman picked some fine examples also bought offbeat but related things guardian figure from the mbete people also has attenuated torso and bulgy fang style legs but rather than standing watch over ancestral relics was designed contain them the figure belly has been hollowed out and fitted with little hinged door for the purpose the variety mask styles more dramatic there are superb examples the called white faced masks southern gabon naturalistically rendered ways that appeal western ideals female beauty from these however one moves near abstract chevron shaped mask with barely recognizable facial features its place origin uncertain next nothing known about its function meaning equally mysterious rare example mask covered with sheet beaten copper expressive appearance not completely carved out from behind and may never have been worn mask all finally even often encountered forms can puzzling striking helmetlike mask with bulging eyes and striated surface type associated with both the luba and songye peoples though its meaning depends the maker the songye use such masks depict evil spirits for the luba they represent benevolent beings short the exhibition like the creative spirit that animates african art has many voices joyous and grave raucous and serene sounding once and they all come through the enchanting selection musical instruments gussman put together carved wood yaka whistle the form squat man with nixonian ski jump nose was meant scare away malevolent forces wooden kongo bell has handle the form little male figure who sits arms knees and head raised alert distant sound frightening alluring amazing fang harp one few known examples its kind was designed produce music ethereal would link the living with the dead this fantastic piece included the portion the gussman material given the neuberger the museum received objects far the largest share the total gift though one can help but wish had the entire holdings there intrinsic value keeping any individual collection intact evidence personal and period taste the presence all the gussman work purchase might have more securely positioned the museum new center for the study african art one that would attract further gifts and academic resources such centers are badly needed but the neuberger involvement with africa going strong solid chunk the museum permanent exhibition space devoted african art and under clarke supervision the the number objects view has been doubled gussman objects will rotated
